    "Include the date in a French informal letter, you can simply write the date at the top of your letter, aligned to the right-hand side of the page. The standard format for writing the date in French is \"day/month/year\". For example, if you were writing the letter on May 4, 2023, you would write the date as \"4 mai 2023\" in French.";

If you are unsure about the gender of the recipient, you can use \"Cher/Chère\" followed by their first name. And it is important to note that \"Cher/Chère\" is a more formal greeting than \"Salut\", which is more casual and appropriate for very close friends or family members. If you are unsure about which greeting to use, it is best to err on the side of formality and use \"Cher/Chère\".";

String Guide4 =

    "\n\nRemember that an informal letter should reflect your personality and relationship with the person you are writing to. Have fun with it and don't be afraid to show your personality and use expressions that are unique to you and your relationship with your friend.";
